          <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/260142955/"> Bryant Ball Game</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
          Bryant Le, also known as Baren Bui, must catch the falling Wilson heads and <br>
          dodge the falling T-poses in the spooky forest in order to preserve his  <br>
          Alpha Leo position. Catching a Wilson head adds 5 points to the score,  <br>
          while failing to capture one reduces the life count by 1 point. Touching  <br>
          a T-pose reduces the life count by 2, while dodging them increases the  <br>
          life count by .1 points. A random variable is used when generating Wilson  <br>
          heads and T-poses. The game gets harder as the player progresses and gets  <br>
          a higher scores by making the Wilson heads and T-poses fall faster. The  <br>
          game ends when the player allows too many Wilson heads to pass or touches <br>
          too many T-poses.
      </p>

          We decided to create a game based on our fellow classmate, deriving inspiration <br>
          from Bryant's funny Alpha Leo video resume. We were successful in creating <br>
          a random sprite generator from a certain x-range, and in creating a smooth <br>
          transition between backgrounds. However, we met difficulties in making the <br>
          sprites fall and in balancing the spawn ratios. We overcame these obstacles <br>
          through the use of if-then statements. If we had more time, we would change <br>
          Bryant's speed to match the difficulty change.

          This line of code is an algorithm because it allows the computer to run <br>
          a line of commands when the sprite is duplicated. This algorithm allows <br>
          the Wilson heads and T-poses to spawn from a random x-value after the sprite<br>
          is cloned. These clones then fall at a constant rate while spinning, and <br>
          changes the score by 5 when it touches Bryant. When it touches the edge, <br>
          it reduces the Life count by 1.
