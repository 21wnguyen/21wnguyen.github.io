      </h3>
      <p>
          Bryant Le, also known as Baren Bui, must catch the falling Wilson heads and <br>
          dodge the falling T-poses in the spooky forest in order to preserve his  <br>
          Alpha Leo position. Catching a Wilson head adds 5 points to the score,  <br>
          while failing to capture one reduces the life count by 1 point. Touching  <br>
          a T-pose reduces the life count by 2, while dodging them increases the  <br>
          life count by .1 points. A random variable is used when generating Wilson  <br>
          heads and T-poses. The game gets harder as the player progresses and gets  <br>
          a higher scores by making the Wilson heads and T-poses fall faster. The  <br>
          game ends when the player allows too many Wilson heads to pass or touches <br>
          too many T-poses.
      </p>
      <p>
          We decided to create a game based on our fellow classmate, deriving inspiration <br>
          from Bryant's funny Alpha Leo video resume. We were successful in creating <br>
          a random sprite generator from a certain x-range, and in creating a smooth <br>
          transition between backgrounds. However, we met difficulties in making the <br>
          sprites fall and in balancing the spawn ratios. We overcame these obstacles <br>
          through the use of if-then statements. If we had more time, we would change <br>
          Bryant's speed to match the difficulty change.

          This line of code is an algorithm because it allows the computer to run <br>
          a line of commands when the sprite is duplicated. This algorithm allows <br>
          the Wilson heads and T-poses to spawn from a random x-value after the sprite<br>
          is cloned. These clones then fall at a constant rate while spinning, and <br>
          changes the score by 5 when it touches Bryant. When it touches the edge, <br>
          it reduces the Life count by 1.

      <h1 id="CYOA"> Ryan Simulator </h1>
      <p>
         Ryan Simulator is a retelling of a real life experience of Ryan Trang, <br>
         currently a sophomore at La Quinta High School. The story begins in <br>
         McGarvin Intermediate and progresses into freshmen year as Ryan <br>
         finds multiple love interests. However, Ryan is unable to become <br>
         anything greater than platonic, and he must turn to tennis to compensate<br>
         for his sadness.

      <p>
         While making Ryan Simulator, I encountered difficulty with connecting the <br>
         different scenes. When I connected the multiple scenes, I tried setting  <br>
         up all of the events at once, but in doing so, I could not run the  <br>
         program to check my progress. So, I was forced to do every event  <br>
         individually. One of the iterative processes that I incorporated into  <br>
         the program was when the user chose the "no" option using the input <br>
         function. Everytime they chose "no", they would return to an entirely <br>
         different story path where Ryan would choose to hang out with his friends <br>
         and play tennis. 
         <br> <br>
         Organizing the scenes of my story is a form of procedural abstraction <br>
         since the storyline is simplified into a series of functions. These functions <br>
         can be reused anywhere inside of the code and always have the same outcome. <br>
         For example, everytime the user entered a "no" option in Ryan Simulator, <br>
         the "bromies()" function would play regardless of where it was. Abstracting <br> 
         the scenes makes it simpler for the programmer to follow, since the scenes <br>
         are organized in a sequential fashion. Also, in the if-statements based  <br>
         on user-input, using the events as functions makes the code cleaner in <br>
         comparison to having an entire storyline within one if-statement.<br>
         <br><br>
         One of the stories I liked the most was Sidney's story since it was a  <br>
         funny and short retelling of Alex's highschool life.
